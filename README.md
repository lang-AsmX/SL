# SL
SL is the standard of the AsmX programming language.

You already know the beginning of "SL". At the end of this title, you can see the numbers that indicate the year of the AsmX programming language standard. For example, a "v" can be added and after that the numbers that indicate the version. For example, "SL23 v1" or simply "SL23v1" means the 2023 language standard of the first version (v1). The absence of a brand version means its first version. 

All AsmX programming language standards:

- SL
    - [SL23](./src/SL23.md)
    - [SL24](./src/SL24.md)
